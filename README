A simple C program that isolates and cleans a C assembly function from GCC
assembly source by name.

It takes gcc intel assembly into it's standard input and outputs the function
named in the first argument, after cleaning up the redundant start and end
code.

It doesn't clean out the redundant code in the middle but it's still a WIP.

Install binary with:
	sudo make install
Install and append vim binds to your .vimrc:
	sudo make install vim-append
Install and include vim binds to .vimrc via a .vim file in ~/.vim/
	sudo make install vim-include

The vim integration binds F6 and F7 in normal mode and F6 in visual mode.
Normal F6:	Put your cursor on a function name and press this key to assemble it.
Normal F7:	Assemble whole file.
Visual F6:	Assemble local function within selection with no external-to-
			function references.

Known bugs:

		If you have a string with "some_name:" aka a string which describes a
	label, the function inclusion will start at the string if you pass it
	"some_name" as a function name.
